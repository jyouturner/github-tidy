## Goals

There are two main goals for this project:

1. have a utility to tidy up github repository branches by archiving and deleting old branches
2. more interestingly, test the solutions with two approaches:
    - use deepseek to generate plans, and use Claude to generate the code based on the plan
    - use Claude directly to generate the code

Note: in both cases, Cursor composer is used to finish the project and code from the Claude outputs.

## Requirements

[Branch Purging and Archival Policy](./requirements.md)

---

## Project generated by combining Deepseek and Claude

[Deepseek and Claude](./deepseek_and_claude)

---

## Project generated by Claude only

[Claude](./claude_only)

---

## Ask Gemini to Evaludate the two projects

First use the combine-files.sh to combine each project into one file.

Then asked Gemini-2.0-Flush-Exp to analyze the two projects and provide a recommendation on which approach is better.

[Prompt to Gemini 2.0 Flush](./per_gemini/prompt.txt)

[Gemini 2.0 Flush Analysis](./per_gemini/response.md)

Gemini-2.0-flush-exp thinks Claude-only is slightly better than the Deepseek-Claude project.

Obviously, our next question to Gemini is ... why don't you improve on the Claude-only project?

---

## Final Claude-Gemini Project

[Claude-Gemini](./claude_and_gemini)

Use Claude-only as the base, and ask Gemini to improve the project.

---

## Gemini-2.0-Flush-Exp's Final Analysis

Then we asked Gemini-2.0-Flush-Exp to analyze the final project by Claude-Gemini. Well, Gemini thinks this one is better, score 8.5/10. (after all, it is based on its suggestions, so bias is expected)

## OpenAI Does Not Agree

Asked gpt-o1-mini to evaludate the claude_gemini project. It score it 7.0/10.

[GPT-O1-Mini Analysis](./per_gpt_o1_mini/response.md)

Obviously, let's ask gpt-o1-mini to improve the project.

## Claude-Gemini-GPT-O1-Mini

[Claude-Gemini-GPT-O1-Mini](./claude_and_gemini_and_o1_mini)

gpt-o1-mimi score (itself) is 9.0/10.

The following conclusion is from GPT-O1-Mini's analysis:

> Conclusion
>
> The enhancements address the previously identified gaps in the project by implementing required features, improving code quality, adding comprehensive documentation, developing a basic test suite, and handling edge cases more robustly. These changes not only align the project more closely with the initial requirements but also ensure better maintainability and scalability for future developments.
>
> Final Score: 9/10
>
> Improvements Achieved:
>
> - Functionality: Implemented tagging, governance workflow, and separate scheduling.
> - Code Structure and Organization: Enhanced with better modularity and separation of concerns.
> - Code Quality and Best Practices: Added docstrings, improved error handling, and validated configurations.
> - Documentation and Readability: Expanded README and added comprehensive docstrings.
> - Testing: Introduced a basic test suite with pytest.
> - Security: Ensured proper handling and validation of environment variables.
> - Extensibility and Maintainability: Modular design facilitates future enhancements.
>
> Remaining Areas for Excellence:
>
> - Comprehensive Testing: Expand the test suite to cover all functionalities and edge cases.
> - Advanced Governance Workflow: Integrate with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools for automated approval processes.
> - Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more sophisticated monitoring and alerting mechanisms for failures.
>
> By addressing these remaining areas, the project can achieve a near-perfect score and be fully production-ready.

## My Non-LLM Final Thoughts

1. Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still good for code generation.
2. Using another model (Gemini-2.0-flush-exp, GPT-o1-mini) to review the code and provide suggestions seems to be a good idea.
3. Love the Cursor Composer, it is a good tool to help me to finish the project by dumping the LLM response and click "Accept All"
