# Github Tidy

There are two main goals for this project:

1. have a utility to tidy up github repository branches by archiving and deleting old branches
2. more interestingly, test the solutions with two approaches:
    - use deepseek to generate plans, and use Claude to generate the code based on the plan
    - use Claude directly to generate the code

Note: in both cases, Cursor composer is used to finish the project and code from the Claude outputs.

## Branch Purging and Archival Policy

### 1. Branch Categorization

#### Protected Branches

- develop
- stage
- master
*(excluded from purging/archival)*

#### Feature/Hotfix/Release Branches

- All other branches *(subject to purging/archival)*

### 2. Criteria for Purging and Archival

- **Inactive Period:** No commits or updates in the last 30 days
- **Merged Status:** Branches already merged into develop, stage, or master

### 3. Archival Process

- **Archival Branch Prefix:** Move inactive branches to a prefixed namespace (e.g., `archived/branch-name`)
- **Tagging:** Optional tagging of latest commit before archiving (e.g., `archived-branchname-YYYYMMDD`)

### 4. Purging Process

- **Retention Period:** Keep archived branches for 60 days before permanent deletion
- **Auto-Deletion:** Automatically delete branches that remain archived and inactive for an additional 60 days

### 5. Exclusions

- Branches with active/open PRs
- Branches linked to critical releases or tagged versions

### Implementation Details

#### A. Automated Scripts

- Weekly execution of archival script
- Monthly execution of purge script

#### B. Notifications and Logging

- Slack/Email notifications before archival and deletion actions
- Action logging in centralized system for audit purposes

#### C. Governance and Approval Workflow

- Optional manual review for critical branches
- Approval process for branch deletion via Pull Requests

## Project generated by combining Deepseek and Claude

[Deepseek and Claude](./deepseek_and_claude)

## Project generated by Claude only

[Claude](./claude_only)

## Ask Gemini to Evaludate the two projects

First use the combine-files.sh to combine each project into one file.

Then asked Gemini-2.0-Flush-Exp to analyze the two projects and provide a recommendation on which approach is better.

[Prompt to Gemini 2.0 Flush](./per_gemini/prompt.txt)


[Gemini 2.0 Flush Analysis](./per_gemini/response.md)

Gemini-2.0-flush-exp thinks Claude-only is slightly better than the Deepseek-Claude project.

Obviously, our next question to Gemini is ... why don't you improve on the Claude-only project?

## Final Claude-Gemini Project

[Claude-Gemini](./claude_and_gemini)

Use Claude-only as the base, and ask Gemini to improve the project.
