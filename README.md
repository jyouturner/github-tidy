## Goals

There are two main goals for this project:

1. have a utility to tidy up github repository branches by archiving and deleting old branches
2. more interestingly, test the solutions with two approaches:
    - use deepseek to generate plans, and use Claude to generate the code based on the plan
    - use Claude directly to generate the code

Note: in both cases, Cursor composer is used to finish the project and code from the Claude outputs.

## Requirements

[Branch Purging and Archival Policy](./requirements.md)

---

## Project generated by combining Deepseek and Claude

[Deepseek and Claude](./deepseek_and_claude)

---

## Project generated by Claude only

[Claude](./claude_only)

---

## Ask Gemini to Evaludate the two projects

First use the combine-files.sh to combine each project into one file.

Then asked Gemini-2.0-Flush-Exp to analyze the two projects and provide a recommendation on which approach is better.

[Prompt to Gemini 2.0 Flush](./per_gemini/prompt.txt)

[Gemini 2.0 Flush Analysis](./per_gemini/response.md)

Gemini-2.0-flush-exp thinks Claude-only is slightly better than the Deepseek-Claude project.

Obviously, our next question to Gemini is ... why don't you improve on the Claude-only project?

---

## Final Claude-Gemini Project

[Claude-Gemini](./claude_and_gemini)

Use Claude-only as the base, and ask Gemini to improve the project.

---

## Gemini-2.0-Flush-Exp's Final Analysis

Then we asked Gemini-2.0-Flush-Exp to analyze the final project by Claude-Gemini. Well, Gemini thinks this one is better, score 8.5/10. (after all, it is based on its suggestions, so bias is expected)

---

## OpenAI Does Not Agree

Asked gpt-o1-mini to evaludate the claude_gemini project. It score it 7.0/10.

[GPT-O1-Mini Analysis](./per_gpt_o1_mini/response.md)

Obviously, let's ask gpt-o1-mini to improve the project.

## Claude-Gemini-GPT-O1-Mini

[Claude-Gemini-GPT-O1-Mini](./claude_and_gemini_and_o1_mini)

gpt-o1-mimi score (itself) is 9.0/10.

---

## Final Thoughts

1. Claude Sonnet 3.5 is still good for code generation.
2. Using another model (Gemini-2.0-flush-exp, GPT-o1-mini) to review the code and provide suggestions seems to be a good idea.
3. Love the Cursor Composer, it is a good tool to help me to finish the project by dumping the LLM response and click "Accept All"
