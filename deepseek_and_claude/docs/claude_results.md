Let's implement this GitHub branch cleanup system. I'll help structure the project and create the core components.



This implementation provides:

1. Modular structure with separate components for GitHub interactions, branch management, and notifications
2. Cloud Functions for weekly archival and monthly purging
3. Firestore integration for tracking archived branches
4. Configurable policies via environment variables
5. Error handling and logging
6. Slack/email notifications

To deploy:

1. Set up GCP project with Cloud Functions and Firestore
2. Configure environment variables:
   - GITHUB_TOKEN
   - GITHUB_ORG
   - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL (optional)
   - EMAIL_RECIPIENTS (optional)

3. Deploy Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler triggers:
   - archive_branches: Weekly
   - purge_branches: Monthly

Let me know if you need help with any specific component or the deployment process.
